            <p>Artificial Intelligence has the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of logistics and transportation. 
            The quick transportation of military goods is an essential part of successful military operations. AI can lower cost 
            and reduce human operational jobs. It also lets armed forces to easily detect abnormalities and predict failures to 
            components. </p>
            
            <p> The Air Force and Army are beginning to use AI to predict aircraft maintenance. 
            Instead of waiting for the vehicle to break, they are using a technology enabled approach that tailors to the needs 
            of an individual aircraft. The military have collaborated with tech companies such as IBM, and have used their 
            AI platform to identify problems in combat vehicles.</p>
