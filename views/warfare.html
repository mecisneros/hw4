    <h2 style="text-align:center">Autonomous Weapons</h2>
	<p>Autonomous Weapon Systems are weapons that use sensors and algorithms to individually select and attack targets without meaningful human control. The systems could produce some very beneficial advantages such as increased efficiency of military actions and less war casualties. This development could change the way war is conducted around the world. Different nations are incorporating AI into weapons and other systems used on land, air, or sea.</p>
 	<p> The trend of autonomous weapons can be demonstrated by a few examples: </p>

	    <p>European countries, led by the French company <b>Dassault Aviation</b>, are developing an unmanned combat aerial vehicle.The aircraft can fly autonomously for over 3 hours for autonomous detection, localization, and reconnaissance of ground targets. The Neuron has fully automated attack capabilities, target adjustment, and communication between systems.</p>
